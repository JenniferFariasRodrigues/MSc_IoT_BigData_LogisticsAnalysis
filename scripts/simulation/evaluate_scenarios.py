Description: This script evaluates the simulated samples for each logistics scenario
by computing statistical and operational metrics related to fuel consumption.

The evaluation includes:
- Estimation of fuel consumption using a placeholder formula based on simulated variables
  (to be replaced by the predictive model in future stages)
- Generation of 100 samples for each defined scenario using generate_simulation_samples(...)
- Integration with scenario_config.py for range definitions
- Calculation of mean fuel consumption per scenario
- Standard deviation to assess variability within each scenario
- Percentage reduction in fuel usage compared to the baseline ('ideal') scenario
- Optional metrics such as median or confidence intervals can be added

Structure:
- Load or simulate data for the three scenarios: 'ideal', 'realista', 'otimizado'
- Apply a simplified fuel consumption formula
- Group results by scenario and compute summary statistics
- Output results to terminal for analysis or export

Usage:
python scripts/simulation/evaluate_scenarios.py

    # Placeholder formula — adjust later with actual model
    # The formula was inspired by three main references that address the influence of these variables on logistics consumption:
    #
    # Wu et al. (2021) — discuss relationships between environmental and operational variables with consumption.
    #
    # Panda et al. (2023) — present the use of composite variables in consumption forecasting and time series modeling.
    #
    # Melo et al. (2024) — discuss modeling based on urban logistics with the impact of inventory and location.
    #
    # It was designed with a weight proportional to the average impact identified in the feature importance and correlation analyses.

    # === Analytical Formula Justification ===
    # This placeholder equation was created to estimate fuel consumption
    # in simulated scenarios, with empirically informed weights:
    #
    # fuel_consumption = 10
    #     - 3 × handling_equipment_efficiency
    #     + 2 × traffic_congestion_level
    #     - 1.5 × warehouse_inventory_level
    #
    # Coefficient sources:
    # - handling_equipment_efficiency: weight -3
    #   Justified by feature importance > 60% in refined XGBoost (see Fig. XGB importance extended)
    #   Also supported by Melo et al. (2024, Table 2 SBESC article), where improvements in equipment/load time reduced fuel use by up to 12%.
    #
    # - traffic_congestion_level: weight +2
    #   Based on Wu et al. (2021), who demonstrated positive correlation between congestion and energy usage in logistics.
    #
    # - warehouse_inventory_level: weight -1.5
    #   Based on moderate positive correlation (r = 0.47) and analysis from Panda et al. (2023, Table 2 SBESC article),
    #   who found higher inventory increased loading time, raising fuel consumption.
    #
    # This formula does not replace the predictive model but enables scenario-based reasoning.
